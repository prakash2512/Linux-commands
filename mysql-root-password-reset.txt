rstly, you must confirm which version of MySQL on Ubuntu you are running as commands will be different.

mysql -V

If on MySQL version 8, you will see something like:

mysql Ver 8.0.20-0ubuntu0.20.04.1 for Linux on x86_64 ((Ubuntu))

If you are on MySQL version 5, you will see something similar to:

mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.36, for Linux (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper

2. Restart MySQL with skip-grant-table

In order to skip the grant tables and reset the root password, we must first stop the MySQL service. Enter your Linux password if prompted.

sudo /etc/init.d/mysql stop

Ensure the directory /var/run/mysqld exists and correct owner set.

sudo mkdir /var/run/mysqld

sudo chown mysql /var/run/mysqld

Now start MySQL with the --skip-grant-tables option. The & is required here.

sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables&

You should see something similar:

[1] 1283
user@server:~$ 2019-02-12T11:15:59.872516Z mysqld_safe Logging to syslog.
2019-02-12T11:15:59.879527Z mysqld_safe Logging to '/var/log/mysql/error.log'.
2019-02-12T11:15:59.922502Z mysqld_safe Starting mysqld daemon with databases from /var/lib/mysql

Now press ENTER to return to the Linux BASH prompt.
3. Change MySQL Root Password

You can now log in to the MySQL root account without a password.

sudo mysql --user=root mysql

Once logged in, you will see the mysql> prompt.
